  - **NOTE:** Layers are always viewed top down, the order in which they are stakced can be observed in the layers panel off to the right

- **Auto Color:** Click Layer you want to apply effect to > Click Image in top tool bar > select Auto Color
  - **NOTE:** No one of these automatic adjustments work the same all the time, its more of a try all three and pick the one that looks the best to you 
- **Vibrance:** Click the adjustments tab in the right hand toolbar > Choose Vibrance (5th Icon) > Adjust Slider to your liking 
  - **NOTE:** Virbrance & saturation basically do the same thing except vibrance does a more blended approach where things that already have a lot of saturation don't become overly saturated. Saturation just makes everything more well, ya know saturated.

  - **NOTE:** Holding down Shift while adjusting the image will scale it un-proportionately or vice-versa depending on settings
  - **NOTE:** Enter will end the transform so you can free up photoshop to do other manipulations
